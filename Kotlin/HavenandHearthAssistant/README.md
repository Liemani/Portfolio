Haven and Hearth Assistant
==========================
My first android application.

I planed my fist app as simple as possible, and as fast as possible.

Because i didn't have many time.

So i Studied Java and UI during 2 weeks.

And after that, i found Kotlin.

I thought Kotlin's syntax is more nice than Java.

So i decided to use Kotlin.

But the environment of Kotlin wasn't good as Java.

But making an app for android using Kotlin wasn't possible.

So making this small app took another 2 weeks.

The total time taken was 4 weeks.
